# A Binary Tree implemented in Python

This is a implementation of a binary tree in Python and with the differente tree traversal algorithms that are possible.

## Features
* Contains, insert and delete methods embedded in Python over loading, permits user call operators "in" or "del". 
* 4 types of tree traversal
  * Depth first pre order
  * Depth first in order
  * Depth first post order
  * Breadth first order
* Tree traversal have the possibility to do in order
  *  Generate list of elements (to_list)
  *  Execute a function for each node with apply_func()
  *  Execute a clousure with the call to a method of an object with apply_func()
* Has a method to draw's the tree in 2D in text mode
* Has a method to balance the tree.
* The BinaryTree class implements iter method so it can be used in for loops and in list List Comprehensions. 
* Has unit tests, that also function as examples of use.  

Note: This implementation is inspired by countless sources of info from the net.
